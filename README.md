Bus-Module-Production Tree Quantitative Tool
=========================

Function introduction  
-----

1. Basic quantitative function:<br>
>>>>Click the icon of the corresponding product to generate a synthetic route tree, set the product's output per minute in the right statistics-product, click on the calculation to generate the result,<br>
>>>>View the calculation results (raw material demand, product/by-product statistics, power reference, factory number statistics, sorter number reference) in the statistics view or tree diagram,<br>
>>>>Different formulas can be switched, and other products except the top of the tree can be switched to no formula<br>

2. Modular function:<br>
>>>>Modularize a recipe in all synthesis trees (or manually add it) to generate a new synthesis tree, and the corresponding intermediate products in other trees in the view will be provided by this tree,<br>
>>>>In statistics-calculation, you can set additional output in addition to the necessary requirements of the module<br>
>>>>Product ratio: You can add the same trees repeatedly, and set them as the ratio of module products (0%~100%)<br>
>>>> (If there are other trees that need this kind of raw material, the demand will be allocated to multiple of the same product in proportion),<br>
>>>>It is designed to coordinate the situation of multiple formulations of the same product. After unified input, the calculation will be normalized to the ratio,<br>
>>>>If the sum of the proportions of all the same products is 100%, there is no error in the normalization process.

3.Module busization:
>>>>After adjusting each module, click this button to sort all the trees in the view, the order is the first-level product, the second-level product... It is convenient to build a production line with a bus structure

hot key  
------
		Left ctrl hold + left mouse button = switch formula  
		Left Alt Hold + Left Mouse Button = Modular Formula  
		The tree view can be zoomed with the mouse wheel, hold the right mouse button and drag the view  
		On the right side of the information bar, hover the mouse on the upper scroll wheel to quickly switch pages  
		Click the blank space to cancel the mouse focus and then the q key opens/closes the information view  
		Cancel the mouse focus and press Enter to execute the calculation  
		Backspace empty reset  
		Select the top product delete to delete the entire production tree
